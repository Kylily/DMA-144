Data Mining and Analytics introduces students to practical fundamentals of data mining and emerging paradigms of data mining and machine learning with enough theory to aid intuition building. 
Objectives:
Foster critical thinking about real-world actionability from analytics.
Develop intuition in various machine learning classification algorithms (e.g. decision trees, feed-forward neural networks, recurrent neural networks, skip-grams) and clustering techniques (e.g. k-means and spectral clustering).
Conduct manual feature engineering (from domain knowledge) vs. machine-induced featurization (representation learning).
Connect practical data mining issues to research that will affect the future practice of data science in a variety of domains.
